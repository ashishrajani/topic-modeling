## Dataset
For this tutorial, we’ll use reusable publicly-available dataset for “media bias” studies. The content of this dataset

3 months from December of 2016 to march 2017. The source of these news articles are from ABC News, CNN news, 
The Huffington Post, BBC News, DW News, TASS News, Al Jazeera News, China Daily and RTE News. All of them are collected
